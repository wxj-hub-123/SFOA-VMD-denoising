# SFOA-VMD Denoising Code (Version 1.0)

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the SFOA-VMD algorithm proposed in our paper for seismic data denoising. The method integrates the Starfish Optimization Algorithm (SFOA) with Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), where SFOA is used to optimize the number of decomposition modes `K` and the penalty factor `Î±` by minimizing the envelope entropy of decomposed modes.
